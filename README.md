# About The Project
This project aims to develop a comprehensive system for modeling and optimizing airport connectivity
and flight routes. The core of the system is a graph-based representation, where each node represents an
airport, and edges represent direct flights between airports. This model allows for the application of
various graph algorithms to analyze and optimize the network of flights.
