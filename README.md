# About The Project
This project aims to develop a comprehensive system for modeling and optimizing airport connectivity
and flight routes. The core of the system is a graph-based representation, where each node represents an
airport, and edges represent direct flights between airports. This model allows for the application of
various graph algorithms to analyze and optimize the network of flights.
# Airport Connectivity Map
The system constructs a graph where airports are nodes, and direct
flights are edges. This map serves as the foundation for analyzing the connectivity of the airport
network, enabling tasks such as finding the shortest path between airports.
# Flight Route Optimization
Building on the connectivity map, the system employs graph
algorithms like DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, Prim’s and Kruskal’s to find the most efficient routes between
airports. This feature helps in identifying optimal routes for passengers and cargo, potentially
reducing travel time and costs.
